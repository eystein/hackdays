Hi! My name is Eystein, and I work for the EPFL Extension School.

With this project we'll display the data first as a plain data table, then add layers of enhancements.

* First with graphics and layout, making sure it works on phones and tablets as well as laptops.
* Second, we can add static graphs, in the form of bar charts or similar.
* Third, we'll add interactivity, so we can see how data changes over time. This can be in the form of animated graphs, or even a map.

So if you have interest in reaching a wide as possible audience, regardless of broadband speeds and devices, this will be for you.

The reason for this layered approach is to make the data both accessible, and good looking.
